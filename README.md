<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This application is made to support sales activities in the f & b industry so that between divisions from cashier to managerial level can coordinate well where all the features in this application are specially designed for this.

Here's why:

- Great responsive display for any device
- Does not reload pages when moving between pages
- made with all the latest and most up-to-date tools and technology today

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
